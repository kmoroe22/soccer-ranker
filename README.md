# soccer-ranker

to compile, run tests and package, use maven to run a clean package from the same directory as the "pom.xml" file:

```cmd
mvn clean package
```

Once the jar is created in ./target/soccer-ranker-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar, the application can be started by:

```cmd
java -cp target\soccer-ranker-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar karabo.moroe.Main
```
